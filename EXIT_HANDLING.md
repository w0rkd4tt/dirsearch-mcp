# Exit Handling Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented comprehensive exit handling for the Dirsearch MCP tool that allows users to gracefully exit the application using multiple methods.

## Exit Methods

### 1. Type "exit" Command
- Users can type "exit" at any prompt throughout the application
- Works in:
  - Main menu selection
  - Target URL input
  - Any other text prompt

### 2. Main Menu Option "0"
- Select option "0" from the main menu
- Asks for confirmation before exiting
- Shows farewell message

### 3. Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt)
- Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit immediately
- Handled gracefully with a shutdown message
- Works during:
  - Menu navigation
  - Scan operations
  - Any waiting state

## Implementation Details

### Added Methods
```python
def _handle_exit(self):
    """Handle graceful exit"""
    self.console.print("\n[yellow]Shutting down...[/yellow]")
    self.console.print("[green]Thank you for using Dirsearch MCP![/green]")
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Exit Handling in Main Loop
- Try-except blocks catch KeyboardInterrupt
- EOFError also handled for terminal closing
- "exit" command checked before processing menu choices

### Exit During Scans
- Scan operations wrapped in try-except
- Shows "Scan interrupted by user" message
- Returns gracefully to main menu

### Visual Indicators
- Main menu shows: "Type 'exit' or press Ctrl+C to quit"
- URL prompt shows: "Enter target URL (or 'exit' to quit)"
- Clear shutdown messages displayed

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Exit from Main Menu
```
Select an option: exit
Shutting down...
Thank you for using Dirsearch MCP!
```

### Example 2: Exit with Ctrl+C
```
^C
Shutting down...
Thank you for using Dirsearch MCP!
```

### Example 3: Exit with Menu Option
```
Select an option: 0
Are you sure you want to exit? [y/n]: y
Thank you for using Dirsearch MCP!
```

### Example 4: Exit During Scan
```
[During scan progress]
^C
Scan interrupted by user
```

## Error Handling
- All exit scenarios handled gracefully
- No stack traces shown to user
- Clean shutdown messages
- Proper cleanup of resources

## Testing
Run the test script to verify exit handling:
```bash
python test_exit_handling.py
```

The implementation ensures users can exit the application cleanly at any point without errors or hanging processes.
