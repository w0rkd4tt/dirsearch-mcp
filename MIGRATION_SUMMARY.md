# Migration and Optimization Summary

## 🚀 Engine Migration Complete

The enhanced dirsearch engine has been successfully integrated into the main tool with the following improvements:

### 1. **Recursive Scanning Fixed** ✅
- **Issue**: Paths with same filename in different directories were skipped
- **Fix**: Changed `_scanned_paths` to store full URLs instead of just path components
- **Result**: Now properly scans `/users`, `/api/users`, `/admin/users` as separate paths

### 2. **Directory Structure Reorganized** 📁
```
dirsearch-mcp/
├── src/              # Source code
├── tests/            # All test files
├── examples/         # Example usage
├── debug/            # Debug tools
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts
├── docs/             # Documentation
├── wordlists/        # Word lists
├── report/           # Scan reports
└── log/              # Log files
```

### 3. **Terminal Output Optimized** 📊
- Limited to 20 lines maximum for better readability
- Results grouped by status code
- Shows count for each status group
- Truncates with "... and X more" when needed

### 4. **Performance Enhancements** ⚡
- Single-thread mode available for sequential scanning
- Recursive depth configurable (default: 3)
- Original wordlist preserved for recursive scans
- Smart display with progress indicators

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Command Line (Quick Scan)
```bash
# Basic scan with optimized output
./dirsearch-mcp -u http://example.com

# Smart mode with recursive
./dirsearch-mcp -u http://example.com --smart

# Monster mode (aggressive)
./dirsearch-mcp -u http://example.com --monster
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Launch interactive menu
./dirsearch-mcp
```

### Python API
```python
from src.core.dirsearch_engine import DirsearchEngine, ScanOptions

engine = DirsearchEngine()
options = ScanOptions(
    threads=1,
    recursive=True,
    recursion_depth=3,
    detect_wildcards=True
)

results = await engine.scan_target(url, wordlist, options)
```

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Recursive Scanning Flow**
   - Scan `example.com` → Find `/api/` (301)
   - Automatically scan `example.com/api/` with same wordlist
   - Continue based on recursion depth

2. **Smart Result Display**
   - Groups results by status code
   - Shows most important findings first
   - Limits output to 20 lines
   - Full results available in reports

3. **Enhanced Wordlists**
   - Support for pentester-specific wordlists
   - DVWA/CTF paths included
   - Monster mode for comprehensive scanning

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fixed Issues
1. URL deduplication now uses full URLs
2. Recursive tracking variables properly initialized
3. State reset includes all tracking sets
4. Crawled paths checked against full URLs

### New Files
- `examples/optimized_demo.py` - Demonstrates new features
- `tests/test_recursive_*.py` - Recursive scan tests
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Modified Files
- `main.py` - Added 20-line display limit
- `src/cli/interactive_menu.py` - Updated result display
- `src/core/dirsearch_engine.py` - Fixed recursive scanning

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with set-based deduplication
- **Speed**: Configurable threads (1-50)
- **Accuracy**: Wildcard detection prevents false positives
- **Coverage**: Recursive scanning ensures deep discovery

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. Run `python examples/optimized_demo.py` to see new features
2. Use `--smart` mode for intelligent scanning
3. Check reports in `report/` directory for full results
4. Configure recursion depth based on target size
